I'm **Sofrware Engineer** and here I want to share all the stuff related to me..

SWE
-------
I'm from Kazakhtan, based in Almaty and working for [EPAM Systems](https://epam.com/).
Graduated from [Kazakh-British Technical University]("https://kbtu.edu.kz/en/) with BS degree in Software Engineering (2021). 

 I've been developing for backend for over 3 years now (using Python most of the time). Iâ€™m keen on problem solving using algorithms and data structures.
 And I'm an enthusiast about open source and knowledge sharing within the community. 

Projects I have worked on
